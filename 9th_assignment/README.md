# 9th assignment
<h2><a href="http://dev-holyif.pantheonsite.io/map3/"> The inclass exercise: Map </a></h2>
<p> For a test, I delete Taiwan.</p>
<h2><a href="http://dev-holyif.pantheonsite.io/timeline/chips_timeline.html">Timeline of potato chips</a></h2>
<p> I once saw an article about the history of potato chips, which is interesting. Based on it, I make this timeline, using different media types including <strong>Images, Soundcloud, Google Map, Youtube video, and a Twitter embedded code.</strong></p>
